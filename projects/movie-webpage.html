            <h1 class="margin text-center"> Movie Webpage  Project</h1>
            <h2> Context</h2>
           <p> For the first sesmenster of SEP 10, Our teacher Mr Muller wanted me and my partner to create a Movie Wepage Project. The Movie Wepage project was a creative way to use our prior HTML and CSS knowledge from past lessons to create a preview of a fictional Movie me and my partner need to come up with. Atfer much discussion for our Movie genre and name , we decided to come up with 3 Steps behind, a psychological horror.</p> 
           <h2> Content</h2>
             <p> As stated before, we had to use prior HTML and CSS information to get full credit for the Movie Webpage Project. The elements and attribues that were maily used for it are but not limited to:</p>
             <ul>
               <li> Paragraph and Heading elements  </li>
               <li> Img element to generate local images.</li>
               <li> Custom Google fonts</li>
               <li> Div and Span elements that are used to customize any elements inside </li>
               <li> Button elements to form a submit button form our code </li>
               <li> Input element for data usage </li>
             </ul>
          <h5> For CSS</h5>
             <ul>   
               <li> Class, element and Id selectors</li>
               <li> Backround colors</li>
               <li> Custom fonts  for elements</li>
               <li> Paddings, marigns, borders for images</li> 
             </ul>
            <p> TO add onto this we needed a plan.md to decide what roles me and my partner are taking to complete this Project. Me and partner also needed to evaluate each other, so active convesations had be held between me and my partner.</p>
            <h2> Reflections</h2>
            <h4> Challenges</h4>
            <p>Our first challenge when  making this project was figuring out what the movie was going to be about . We already had some trobule figuring out the genre of the Movie and me and my partner, with litte ideas to spare, we couldn't think of anything. We finally decided on what we wanted to do atfer taking in the fact the project is physcological horror, so it needs to be someone experencing something dark and paradoxical. My partner then developed the idea further to what we have in our project. </p>

            <p> Another (more personal) challenged faced during the project was deciding on what extra CSS elements to use in the project, I asked my teacher, Mr Muller to if we can use any CSS elements in w3.schools, and he gave me the green light. I wanted to project to look as decorative as possible so I spent a while looking for any CSS elements that may add special effects to the images or texts, losing track of time in the process. I realized with minnimal time left I didnt need to be perfect or too complex with the designs for the Project and taking in the MVP ( Minniumm Viable Product) rule, I just decided that some color gradients and text shadows were just enough for the project to look fine.</p>
            <h4> Takeaways </h4>
             <ul>
               <li> One thing I found useful in my projects is if you are working with a partner for this, try to combine your strengths to get a better field of view for who is doing what or what to do for the project. Trust me, this helps a lot.</li>  
               <li> Another thing I found useful was to not stress too much on making your project look exceptional, try to start small and foucs on the basics, then if you have time focus on making your project more eye catching or appealing.</li>
             </ul>
        
            <h3> Next Steps </h3>
            <p>My next steps on future projects is to probally lower the size  and change the formatting the images as it was hard to import a part of the Project onto this website. I also want to use the free time I have  to possible look up more HTML inputs or CSS animations for a  Movie sequel (if we make one) to make the project even more appealing and creative. That being said I am grateful to have a hard working parnter for this project and to get creative in the project in the first place Hopefully we do more projects like this! </p>
          
            
            <p>Sorry the text is so small, it reads: "Jona knows he's being watched. He can feel their eyes on him, every hour, minute, second. Every corner he turns he can hear the quiet footstpes following behind. He knows theres nothing he can do about it. A click of the camera, and they're 'gone'. He can't trust them. Not his mother, sister, best friend. Nobody." </p>
